      'To this aim, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) to (i) extract tools that allow for and support the creation of MLOps pipelines and (ii) analyze their main characteristics and features to provide a comprehensive overview of their value. Overall, we investigate the functionalities of 13 MLOps Tools. Our results show that most MLOps Tools support the same features but apply different approaches that can bring different advantages, depending on user requirements.',

      'In this paper, we expanded the current body of knowledge on data smells by proposing a two-step investigation into the matter. First, we updated an existing literature review in an effort of cataloguing the currently existing data smells and the tools to detect them. Afterward, we assess the prevalence of data smells and their correlation with data quality metrics. We identify a novel set composed of 12 data smells distributed across three additional categories.',
