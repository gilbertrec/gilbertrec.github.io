      'To this aim, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) to (i) extract tools that allow for and support the creation of MLOps pipelines and (ii) analyze their main characteristics and features to provide a comprehensive overview of their value. Overall, we investigate the functionalities of 13 MLOps Tools. Our results show that most MLOps Tools support the same features but apply different approaches that can bring different advantages, depending on user requirements.',
