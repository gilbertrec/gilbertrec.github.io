    description: 'The definition of technical debt highly analyzed in traditional '
      + 'systems (i.e., a set of sub-optimal design choices that can affect negatively the data and the '
      + 'quality of the system). Recent studies started the exploration of technical debt present in '
      + 'machine learning and artificial intelligence systems, called AI Technical Debt (AITD). My '
      + 'research activities aims to define a full defined taxonomy that describes the several instances '
      + 'that can cause quality issues. During my thesis experience, I have analyzed the (i) frequency, '
      + '(ii) severity and (iii) impact of the instances of AITD from the developerâ€™s perception.',
